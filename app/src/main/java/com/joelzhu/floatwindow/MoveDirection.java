 * 1) {@link #X_AXIS}: Only work on the delta value on X-Axis, ignore the moving delta value on Y-Axis.
 * 2) {@link #Y_AXIS}: Only work on the delta value on Y-Axis, ignore the moving delta value on X-Axis.
 * 3) {@link #FIRST_DIRECTION}: Can move towards both two axes(X-Axis and Y-Axis), but only one axis worked, it
 *      was decided by the axis when moving at the first time. But the specified axis is temporary, it can be changed
 *      at the next moving event.
 * 4) {@link #ANY_DIRECTION}: No more special conditions, it can be moved towards any where in the screen.
